## Changelog

### 2024/09/22

Reorganize into folders to get a better overview.

### 2024/09/12

Add `mein-mmo.de` to `scam`, `hate-and-junk` as well as `suspicious`, as they increasingly bash on Twitch streamer and
thus demonstrably provide subjective reports instead of being objective, as one would expect from such sites. See their
current drama with Shurjoka.  
However, this has become the norm for German journalism, which has become a real piece of untrustable shit.  
Due to their continuous attempt to stir up hatred against those who do not support the current loud idiology, they are
also to be classified as `neofascism`.

### 2024/08/06

Add `neofascism.csv`. This list contains domain names, which spread hate and lies in a fascist manner.

### 2024/04/15

Add `smtp-abuse.v4.csv`. This list contains IP addresses that have become noticeable. For example, by testing
credentials or sending suspicious user agents to a mail server.  
As this list is fairly new, and my honeypot has not yet collected that many IP addresses, it is to be expected that it
will grow considerably.

Adding dzikawa. An "artist" who is willing to be corrupted and joins in with bullying and hate speech without flinching. Even long-time supporters are mercilessly bullied by her and her team. Categories: Malware, hate-and-junk, scam and abuse.
Scam because there are very significant similarities, especially her Mononoke thing, to another artist and dzikawa's paintings look as if she traced them. Also adding stumpyfongo for similar reasons.

* artistmarciax.com
